## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and inclusive in your interactions with other contributors. Harassment or offensive behavior will not be tolerated.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to this project:

1. **Add New Super-Resolution Models**: Implement new state-of-the-art models.
2. **Improve Existing Models**: Optimize or enhance current implementations.
3. **Add New Metrics**: Implement additional evaluation metrics.
4. **Enhance Documentation**: Improve explanations, add examples, or fix errors.
5. **Fix Bugs**: Address any issues in the codebase.
6. **Add Features**: Implement new functionality to enhance the project.
7. **Report Issues**: Identify and report problems or suggest improvements.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Image-Super-Resolution-Enhancement.git
   cd Image-Super-Resolution-Enhancement
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup development environment**:
   ```bash
   python setup_environment.py
   ```

## Adding New Models

To add a new super-resolution model:

1. Create a new Python file in the `models` directory, e.g., `models/new_model.py`.
2. Implement your model following the existing structure. Your model should include:
   - Model architecture
   - Training methodology
   - Inference functionality
3. Update the training script (`train.py`) to support your new model.
4. Update the evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) to evaluate your model.
5. Update the inference script (`inference.py`) to use your model.
6. Add test cases if applicable.
7. Update documentation to describe your new model.

Here's a basic template for adding a new model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

class NewSRModel:
    """Your new super-resolution model."""
    
    def __init__(self, scale_factor=4):
        """Initialize model.
        
        Args:
            scale_factor: Scale factor for super-resolution.
        """
        self.scale_factor = scale_factor
        self.model = self._build_model()
    
    def _build_model(self):
        """Build the model architecture."""
        # Define your model architecture here
        input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))
        # Add your model layers
        output_layer = layers.Conv2D(3, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='tanh')(x)
        
        return Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    
    def train(self, train_dataset, val_dataset, epochs=100, steps_per_epoch=1000):
        """Train the model."""
        # Implement training logic
        pass
    
    def save(self, filepath):
        """Save the model."""
        self.model.save(filepath)
    
    def load(self, filepath):
        """Load a pre-trained model."""
        self.model = tf.keras.models.load_model(filepath)
    
    def predict(self, lr_image):
        """Generate super-resolved image from low-resolution input."""
        # Implement prediction logic
        return self.model.predict(lr_image)
```

## Extending Utilities

To add new utility functions:

1. Identify the appropriate utility file in the `utils` directory.
2. Add your new function with proper documentation.
3. Update relevant scripts to use your utility function.
4. Add test cases if applicable.

## Testing

Before submitting your contribution, please test your changes:

1. **Test with different images**: Ensure your code works with different image types and sizes.
2. **Test with different scale factors**: Verify functionality across scale factors (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.).
3. **Benchmark performance**: Measure the time and resource usage.
4. **Verify metrics**: Make sure evaluation metrics are calculated correctly.

## Style Guide

Please follow these guidelines for your code:

1. **PEP 8**: Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide.
2. **Docstrings**: Include detailed docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods.
3. **Typing**: Use type hints for function arguments and return values.
4. **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex sections of code.
5. **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit them with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

3. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Open a pull request** from your fork to the main repository.
5. **Describe your changes** in the pull request, including:
